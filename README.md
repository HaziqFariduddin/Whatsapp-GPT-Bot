How it works:

The Whatsapp GPT Bot listens for incoming messages from users and processes them accordingly. If the message contains a request for image generation, the bot leverages the image-generator-client library to create a relevant image based on the user's prompt. It then sends the generated image back to the user with a descriptive message.

For other types of messages, the bot engages GPT-3.5-turbo to generate contextually appropriate responses. It uses OpenAI's chat completion API to craft a reply that aligns with the bot's predefined persona and characteristics. The generated response is then sent back to the user, maintaining a natural and engaging conversation flow.
